## 2000 | George W. Bush (R) v. Al Gore (D)

The election of 2000 was extremely close, with **George W. Bush** winning the presidency of the United States despite losing the popular vote to Democrat **Al Gore**. It was the fourth time something similar happened (the first one since 1888) and the tightest election since 1876 when Rutherford Hayes defeated Samuel Tilden by a single electoral vote.

The result on the evening of election day of the election was a virtual tie. As a result, everything depended on the outcome in Florida, where the difference in votes was astonishingly close (slightly over 500) between Bush and Gore.

A recount of some ballots had begun when [the United States Supreme Court intervened](https://www.britannica.com/event/Bush-v-Gore), stopped any further recount, and declared the Republican candidate the winner, the first of his two mandates.

## 2004 | George W. Bush (R) v. John Kerry (D)

The infamous [9/11](https://www.state.gov/23rd-anniversary-of-the-september-11-2001-attacks/) and the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts derived from that massive terrorist act were the main issues of this presidential campaign, followed by several domestic affairs.

On November 2, President Bush defeated Democrat **John Kerry** with 286 votes from the electoral college (a majority of 270 was needed to win the presidency) and 50.73% of the popular vote.

## 2008 | Barack Obama (D) v. John McCain (R)

The 2008 United States presidential election was held on November 4. The actions and policies of the outgoing President George W. Bush triggered the American's desire for change. 

Domestic policy and the economy eventually emerged as the main themes in the last few months of the election campaign after the onset of the 2008 economic crisis, a.k.a. [the Great Recession](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/great-recession-and-its-aftermath), dubbed the [worst financial crisis](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/2008-financial-crisis-3305679) since the Great Depression of 1929.

Democrat **Barack Obama**, then junior Senator from Illinois, defeated Republican **John McCain**. Obama achieved almost 70 million popular votes, 52.93 %. Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia changed adherence from the 2004 election, reflecting the wind of change among the American population.

The selected electors from the 50 states and the District of Columbia voted for President and Vice President of the United States on December 15. Obama eventually doubled McCain in electoral votes (365 to 173).

## 2012 | Barack Obama (D) v. Mitt Rommey (R)

The 2012 United States presidential election took place on November 6. The Democratic nominee, President **Barack Obama**, and his running mate, Vice President Joe Biden, were elected to a second term. They defeated the GOP formula of **Mitt Romney** and Paul Ryan.

Only four states were decided by less than a 5% popular vote margin. Obama got 65,915,795 ballots, 5.15% less than four years ago but still over 50%. The incumbent became the second president elected to a second term with fewer electoral votes than earned when winning the first term. The first was **Woodrow Wilson** in 1916.

## 2016 | Donald Trump (R) v. Hillary Clinton (D)

The 2016 U.S. presidential election was held on November 8, 2016. Republican candidate **Donald J. Trump** defeated Democrat **Hillary Clinton**, despite achieving fewer popular votes. Still, the former Secretary of State made history by being the first female presidential nominee of a major political party.

Clinton received nearly 2.9 million more votes nationwide, but the GOP nominee triumphed in the Electoral College, winning 30 states with 306 pledged electors out of 538. 

Trump conquered the [swing states](https://www.polyas.com/election-glossary/swing-states) of Florida, Iowa, and Ohio as well as the [“blue wall”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_wall_(U.S._politics)) of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which had been Democratic fortresses in presidential elections since the 1990s. Before the election, most media outlets considered a Trump victory unlikely.

It was the fifth election (the first since Bush v. Gore in 2000) in which the winner lost the popular vote. The other three occasions when this occurred were in 1824, 1876 and 1888.
