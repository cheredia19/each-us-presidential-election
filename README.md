## 2000 | George W. Bush v. Al Gore

The election of 2000 was extremely close, with **George W. Bush** winning the presidency of the United States despite losing the popular vote to Democrat **Al Gore**. It was the fourth time something similar happened (the first one since 1888) and the tightest election since 1876 when Rutherford Hayes defeated Samuel Tilden by a single electoral vote.

The result on the evening of election day of the election was a virtual tie. As a result, everything depended on the outcome in Florida, where the difference in votes was astonishingly close (slightly over 500) between Bush and Gore.

A recount of some ballots had begun when [the United States Supreme Court intervened](https://www.britannica.com/event/Bush-v-Gore), stopped any further recount, and declared the Republican candidate the winner, the first of his two mandates.

## 2004 | George W. Bush v. John Kerry

The infamous [9/11](https://www.state.gov/23rd-anniversary-of-the-september-11-2001-attacks/) and the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts derived from that massive terrorist act were the main issues of this presidential campaign, followed by several domestic affairs.

On November 2, President Bush defeated Democrat **John Kerry** with 286 votes from the electoral college (a majority of 270 was needed to win the presidency) and 50.73 of the popular vote.
