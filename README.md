## 2000 | George W. Bush v. Al Gore

The election of 2000 was extremely close, with **George W. Bush** winning the presidency of the United States despite losing the popular vote to Democrat **Al Gore**. It was the fourth time something similar happened (the first one since 1888) and the tightest election since 1876 when Rutherford Hayes defeated Samuel Tilden by a single electoral vote.

The result on the evening of election day of the election was a virtual tie. As a result, everything depended on the outcome in Florida, where the difference in votes was astonishingly close (slightly over 500) between Bush and Gore.

A recount of some ballots had begun when [the United States Supreme Court intervened](https://www.britannica.com/event/Bush-v-Gore), stopped any further recount, and declared the Republican candidate the winner, the first of his two mandates.
